# Append Characters to String to Make Subsequence

**Difficulty:** Medium

## Problem Statement

You are given two strings `s` and `t` consisting of only lowercase English letters.

Return the minimum number of characters that need to be appended to the end of `s` so that `t` becomes a subsequence of `s`.

A subsequence is a string that can be derived from another string by deleting some or no characters without changing the order of the remaining characters.

## Examples

**Example 1**
```
Input:  s = "coaching", t = "coding"
Output: 4
Explanation: Append "ding" to the end of s so that s = "coachingding".
             Now t is a subsequence of s.
             Appending any 3 characters will never make t a subsequence.
```

**Example 2**
```
Input:  s = "abcde", t = "a"
Output: 0
Explanation: t is already a subsequence of s.
```

**Example 3**
```
Input:  s = "z", t = "abcde"
Output: 5
Explanation: Append "abcde" to the end of s so that s = "zabcde".
             Now t is a subsequence of s.
             Appending any 4 characters will never make t a subsequence.
```

## Constraints

- `1 <= s.length, t.length <= 10^5`
- `s` and `t` consist only of lowercase English letters.
