# 3970. Shortest Path With At Most K Consecutive Identical Characters

**Difficulty:** Medium

## Problem

You are given an integer `n` representing the number of nodes in a directed weighted graph, numbered from 0 to `n - 1`. This is represented by a 2D integer array `edges`, where `edges[i] = [u_i, v_i, w_i]` represents a directed edge from node `u_i` to node `v_i` with weight `w_i`.

You are also given a string `labels` of length `n`, where `labels[i]` is the character assigned to node `i`, and an integer `k`.

Return the minimum total edge weight of a path from node 0 to node `n - 1` such that the concatenation of the labels of the nodes along the path contains at most `k` consecutive identical characters. If no valid path exists, return -1.

**Note:** Nodes and edges may be revisited.

## Examples

### Example 1

```
Input: n = 3, edges = [[0,1,1],[1,2,1],[0,2,3]], labels = "aab", k = 1
Output: 3
```

**Explanation:**

The optimal valid path from node 0 to node 2 is as follows:

- Use `edges[2] = [0, 2, 3]` to reach node 2 with a weight `w_i = 3`.

The corresponding concatenation of labels is `"ab"`, which satisfies at most `k = 1` consecutive identical characters. Thus, the answer is 3.

### Example 2

```
Input: n = 3, edges = [[0,1,1],[1,2,1],[0,2,3]], labels = "aab", k = 2
Output: 2
```

**Explanation:**

The optimal valid path from node 0 to node 2 is as follows:

- Use `edges[0] = [0, 1, 1]` to reach node 1 with weight `w_i = 1`.
- Use `edges[1] = [1, 2, 1]` to reach node 2 with weight `w_i = 1`.

The corresponding concatenation of labels is `"aab"`, which satisfies at most `k = 2` consecutive identical characters. Thus, the answer is 2.

### Example 3

```
Input: n = 3, edges = [[0,1,1],[1,2,1]], labels = "aaa", k = 2
Output: -1
```

**Explanation:**

There is no valid path from node 0 to node 2 that satisfies at most `k = 2` consecutive identical characters. Thus, the answer is -1.

## Constraints

- `1 <= n == labels.length <= 5 * 10^4`
- `0 <= edges.length <= 5 * 10^4`
- `edges[i] == [u_i, v_i, w_i]`
- `0 <= u_i, v_i <= n - 1`
- `u_i != v_i`
- `1 <= w_i <= 10^4`
- `labels` consists of lowercase English letters
- `1 <= k <= 50`
